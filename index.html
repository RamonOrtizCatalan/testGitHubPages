        <h3>What is Open TOPAS ?</h3>
        <p>TOPAS wraps and extends the Geant4 Simulation Toolkit to make advanced Monte Carlo simulation of all forms of radiotherapy easier to use for medical physicists. TOPAS can model x-ray and particle therapy treatment heads, model a patient geometry based on CT images, score dose, fluence, etc., save and replay a phase space, provides advanced graphics, and is fully four-dimensional (4D) to handle variations in beam delivery and patient geometry during treatment. TOPAS users configure pre-built components (such as nozzles, patient geometry, dosimetry and imaging components) to simulate a wide variety of radiation therapies ...</p>
